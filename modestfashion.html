<h2>What is Modest Fashion?</h2>
<p>Modest fashion is not as easily defined as sustainable fashion as it is
  very much up to interpretation. One's definition depends on many different
  factors, including where they live, what they believe, and what media they're
   exposed to.
   <br>
   To find out more about what people define modest fashion as, I interviewed
   people from different countries, different age groups, and different beliefs
   to see what they thought of when they heard the term "modest fashion", and these are
   some responses I got:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"Fashionable clothing that doesn't reveal too much"</li>
  <li>"I would say modest fashion would be related to anything that has to
    do with hijabs... well anything that could link fashion and Muslim women
    in general"</li>
  <li>"I think of wearing the hijab, with the arms, legs, and body completely
    covered (maybe showing the forearm or a bit of the calf)"</li>
  <li>"When I hear modest fashion, I immediately think of girls wearing what
    they want and the comfortability they are seeking. Not for looks but
    for contentment"</li>
</ul>
<p>A general trend was that most people associated modest fashion with Islam,
  especially with women in Islam, and it seemed as if the media thought the
  same. I asked the same people about whether or not they saw examples of
  modest clothing in the media, and where they saw it if they did:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"At the moment, I can't think of one, but I'm not totally educated on it"</li>
  <li>"No, sadly"</li>
  <li>"No"</li>
  <li>"[This is] the first time I've heard about modest fashion ever, but when it
    comes to influencers, I know that the first time I saw a Muslim model on the
    runway was a girl during Zendaya's TommyxZendaya fashion show... It was the
    first time I actually saw something that every Muslim woman could wear
    while respecting the values of Islam being presented in a fashion show"</li>
  <li>"Not explicity, no. Other than Halima (the girl from the TommyxZendaya
      fashion show), most celebrities who have come from my background have
      converted to the more western way of dressing, which leaves me unable to
      relate to them in that sense"</li>
</ul>
<p>If people did not see much representation of modest fashion in the media,
  how then did they come to associate it with Islam?</p>
<br>
<p>While portrayal of modest fashion in the media is fairly limited, something
  that isn't is the portrayal of Muslim women in hijabs, niqabs, and burkas.
  This means that people and companies are basing modest fashion off of one
  specific group of people, a lot of which aren't even worried about fashion,
  since most women who wear burkas or niqabs are not wearing them for fashion.</p>
<br>
<p>While this might allow some Muslim women to feel as if they can relate to
  fashion, it leaves out many other people, both Muslim and non-Muslim, and male
  and female, who want to dress "modestly" for other reasons, such as personal
  preference for modesty, or just feeling self conscious when wearing something
  they don't find as modest.</p>
<p>In order to make sure this conclusion was shared by the people I interviewed,
  I asked them whether or not they thought that modest fashion should be
  presented in a more secular manner, or whether it was fine as it was. These
  were the responses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"I think it should be presented in a more secular manner"</li>
  <li>"If it's normal everyday street clothes that are just made to be more
    modest, I don't think I'd see a problem with that"</li>
  <li>"I think it's fine as it is, but I'm not educated enough on the topic
    to have a valid opinion about it"</li>
  <li>"100% more secular. Although I'm religious and do wear somewhat modest
    clothing because of that, I don't wear clothes as modest as most Muslims or
    hijabis, but I do like to dress more modestly than most western people.
    This means I'm stuck in the middle, which is why I think, if there wasn't
    some sort of 'taboo' around modest clothing, people would be more comfortable
    wearing what they please, without the fear of being judged for being either
    'too modest' or 'not modest enough'."</li>
</ul>
<p>For the last response, most people were fairly split, however many people
  shared the response that it should be more secular in order to allow for a
  larger group of people to feel involved.</p>
<p>While most brands that classify their clothing as modest would be aimed more
  towards hijabi women, there are some clothes in certain companies that some
  may view as more modest, such as:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Maxi dresses</li>
  <li>Midi length dresses</li>
  <li>Maxi skirts</li>
  <li>Midi skirts</li>
  <li>Shirts</li>
  <li>Pantsuits</li>
  <li>Long sleeved tops</li>
</ol>

</div>
<div class="mididress">
  <img src="midi.jpg">
</div>
<div class="maxiskirt">
  <img src="maxiskirt.jpg">
</div>

<p>These are just some of the many options of "modest" clothing that are easily
  available in many stores, even if they are not marketed as such.</p>
<p>While modest fashion should be included more prominently in the media in a
  more secular manner, there are fashion brands that do have modest clothing.
  It is important however to market it as modest clothing in order to make it
  easier and more accessible for those who are looking for it.</p>
