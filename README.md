# final.project-sustainable
My final project is centred around fashion and focuses on two different aspects of it: modest fashion, and sustainable fashion.
My goal in doing the project was to educate people on ways that they can be more environmentally and socially conscious
when it comes to buying clothing, and to educate people on why modest fashion should be more secular and find examples of 
modest fashion in stores that don't market it as such.

# Challenges
* Figuring out how to style the table
* Having my code in two separate folders
* Having GitHub stop working

# Next Steps
1. Sort out the css to make the text colours match and the pictures line up
2. Add a picture carousel
3. Find companies that have "modest" clothing 
4. Add more companies to the sustainable fashion table
