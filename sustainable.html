<h2>What is sustainable fashion?</h2>
<p>Sustainable fashion is fashion, or clothes, shoes, and accessories that are
  environmentally friendly. This means:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the product is produced using natural resources, such as water,
     energy, land, and soil, as sparingly and efficiently as possible to reduce
     the amount used
  <li>while the product is being produced, the energy used to produce it is
      renewable
  <li>the product is as conducive to being reused, repaired, or recycled as
    possible
</ul>
<p>The other aspect of sustainable fashion is making sure the conditions for
  all those involved are ethical and optimal. This includes workers in positions
  such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>field work
  <li>factory work
  <li>transportation
  <li>sales
</ul>

<p>Since sustainability has only become a prominent issue more recently, many
  people simply do not know which brands have a policy of sustainability, which
  makes it harder for them to shop sustainably. The following are sustainable
  clothing brands at different price points.</p>
